## Introduction

This GitHub project consists on a pdf report called Alca√±izMiguel-galtonbox.pdf, a python file called galton_board.py, the MIT Licence and this ReadMe.

In this programming assignment, it is written a Python program to simulate a Galton board, also known as a Galton box, quincunx, or bean machine. This device is used to illustrate the central limit theorem, particularly that with a sufficiently large sample, the binomial distribution is approximated by the normal distribution. More explanations are given in the pdf report.

## Requirements

This project requires Python to be installed and the following Python libraries:
- `math`
- `random`
- `numpy` (`np`)
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

pip install numpy matplotlib scipy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```python
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/galton-box-simulation.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```python
   cd galton-box-simulation

3. Install python and the necessary dependencies (as shown in the Requirements). E.g.:
   ```python
   pip install numpy matplotlib scipy

## Usage

To run the Galton Box simulation, simply execute the Python script galton_box.py.

    ```python
    python galton_box.py

Examples an explanations of the results are given in the pdf report file.
